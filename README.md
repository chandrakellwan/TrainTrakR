# TrainTrakR

The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Users from many different machines are be able to view the same train times. 

Users are able to also add trains to the schedule.

    o Frequency -- in minutes
